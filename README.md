 ## Guide for KB-E (Kernel Building - Essentials) ##
   ## By Artx/Stayn <jesusgabriel.91@gmail.com> ##

This Guide is going to tell you all the basics and functionality of this
program made for automatic building of all your Kernel related process as
your please (Only Kernel for now).

Basically, this program can handle the Kernel Building automatically with
predefined by user data, you don't need a lot of knowledge to run this program
and build your own kernel, this software is going to download and install
all required tools to make your Kernel Building an easy task (Even the
crosscompiler is downloaded automatically).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Let's talk about the program: ##

In order to run this program, you have to run "core.sh", this is the main script,
to execute it, run ". core.sh" has a command and the program will initialize, after
this, you'll be prompted to accept an disclaimer, it's very important, because this 
software is going to require "sudo" access (To set the right permissions), then,
you'll be into the first run and once it's finished, you can execute this program 
again to start the config process where this program will prompt you for the session
needed information

# 'essentials' Command #

Here is where you start once you finish setting all the configs, 'essentials' is the 
main command of this program, but it only works with flags, otherwise it'll display
the flags information that I'm gonna explain right now:

## '--kernel' Flag: ##

This flag added to the command 'essentials' (essentials --kernel) is going to build
your kernel automatically using the data that you entered previously, you don't have
to worry about anything at this process if the kernel that you're building doesn't 
have any errors in his code.

If you allowed the kernel building debug during the program configuration then you'll 
see the compile process and if there's an error it will be more easy to you to fix it, 
however, if you're running it without kernel building debug then if there's an error 
everything will be logged into './resources/logs/' folder

The Kernel built is going to be stored into './out/zImagesNew/'. If you build a new
kernel for the same device and variant, then your old kernel will be moved to 
'./out/zImages/' and the new one to './out/zImagesNew/'. The kernel name is the
same has device variant name.

## '--dtb' Flag ##

This flag added to the command 'essentials' (essentials --dtb) is going to build the
variant dtb (Device tree) image for your specific device and variant, this only applies
to 32bits devices. It's highly recommended to build it because it's the specific device
tree image for the kernel that you're going to build

The dtb image built is going to be stored into './out/dt/'.

## '--anykernel' Flag ## 

This flag added to the command 'essentials' (essentials --anynerel) is going to build 
the installer for your variant using AnyKernel by osm0sis, during the configuration this
program gives to you 3 options:

1) You can use the local AnyKernel template that is going to be extracted into 
'./out/aktemplate/', this process is done during the configuration phase, for this option
once the configuration is done you've to configure the template extracted

2) Download a template from your MEGA Account, you'll be prompted for entering the path of
this template, you've to enter the folder where it belongs and then the file name that 
*Must* be compressed into a .zip file, if the path is correctly given, your template is
going to be downloaded and extracted into './out/mega_aktemplate/'. Don't worry if you 
dont have MEGATools installed, this software is going download and install it

3) Manually set your own template into './out/aktemplate/' folder, that's it.

## '--upload' Flag ##

This flag added to the command 'essentials' (essentials --upload) is going to upload your
recently AnyKernel installer to your MEGA Account, if you don't have MEGA Installed this
software is going to download and install it

## '--all' Flag ##

This flag added to the command 'essentials' (essentials --all) will do everything the above
flags do, in order. Very useful if you want to do automatically all the processes from 
building the kernel to uploading it ready to install.

*NOTE* that all the above flags except '--all' can be combined, no matter in which order,
all the functions are going to be done in order to prevent an error (For example: 
'essentials --anykernel --kernel' will build the kernel and then build the installer)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Other program commands (Functions) #

You can manually execute the functions of this program, there's a lot of them used by this
software and I'll explain here some of them:

- checkfolders
- checkenvironment
- megacheck
- buildkernel
- buildkernel_debug
- build_dtb
- make_anykernel
- megaupload
- kbeclear

I'll explain each one:

## checkfolders ##

This command will check in there's all folders needed to start working in your
environment, to be more specific, it creates an "out" folder and inside it other
sub-folders that I'll explain:

out: Main output folder
out/zImagesNew: Recently built zImages
out/zImages: Last Built zImages
out/newzips: New Zips built output folder (AROMA/AnyKernel/Others)
out/aktemplate: Base Zips for new kernel installer builds (AnyKernel)
out/mega_aktemplate: Base Zips for new kernel installer builds from MEGA (AnyKernel)
out/dt: New Device Tree Images for each variants (dtb)

## checkenvironment ##

This command will check for the path of your crosscompiler,  Also, it'll check 
the DTB tool that you shouldn't worry about because it's included in ./resources/dtb/dtbToolLineage, it'll check also check for the Zip Tool to re-pack
your new AnyKernel installer and some android Development tools needed in your Linux installation.

Note that, if this program doesn't detect the crosscompiler path, kernel
building process will be cancelled (In which case it would be extremely rare because
this software auto-downloads the correspondent crosscompiler).

## megacheck ##

This command will check if MEGA is installed, if it is, it's going the check for
the ~/.megarc configuration file for automatic login and uploads (This file is
used only by megatools program, there's nothing else in the whole code of this 
software that makes use of it).

You can also run this program with --reconfigure flag (megacheck --reconfigure)
to re-configure megarc file, I mean, to change the email, password or both in
case of an error or you just want to use another account

## buildkernel ##

This is the command to initialize Kernel Building, if your crosscompiler path is
set correctly, this will build the kernel on the source that you previously
selected after running the main script of this program (./core.sh). If there was
an compilation error it'll prompt to you to open the buildkernel_log.txt file
where you can see what went wrong in the process. After a successful build, the
old kernel built (it theres one) will be moved to "./out/zImages" and new Kernel
will be copied to "./out/zImagesNew".

## buildkernel_debug ##

This is the same script as above with two differences:

1) This will show all the compilation process in the screen

2) buildkernel_log.txt isn't gonna be used here because you'll see all the
process

## build_dtb ##

This command will generate the dt.img (Device Tree Image) using the
dtbToolLineage inside './resources/dtb/', the file will be renamed to the variant
name specified for your phone and moved to './out/dtb'.

## make_anykernel ##

This command will work depending on which option you selected during the
configuration phase of this software, if you selected to use the local template
or manually set the template this command will simply take the lastest kernel
and dtb for the specified variant and make a new installer with it made into 
'./out/aktemplate/' and moved to './out/newzips/'.

If you selected to download and extract the template from MEGA, then this 
command will do the same but using the './out/mega_aktemplate' folder instead 
to make a new installer.

## megaupload ##

No, I'm not talking about old megaupload.com, this command will upload your 
new kernel installer into the root of your MEGA Account, that's all :)

## kbeclear ##

This command will make a full cleaning of your KB-E folder, if you break 
something or this software isn't working as expected you can always try to
make a full cleaning of this program using that command. This will not delete
your source folder.

---

## IMPORTANT ##

Don't use these commands when you're building anything for multi-variants, 
rather use the essentials command, this will only work the first variant

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# defaultsettings.sh #

As I said before, this program will prompt to you for data that'll be used
during all the processes, but, here comes the "./defaultsettings.sh".

*defaultsettings.sh*: This configuration file is designed to have all the data
used during the program execution, all the data that is prompted to the user
can be pre-defined here in this file, you just have to modify his settings and
enable it (There's a variable named "DSENABLED", change the value to 1), and
the program will no longer ask you for necessary data, this will make a more
faster and automatized session of this program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Variables #

This program uses a lot of variables, but, some of them can be changed during 
the a session, it could be very useful if you want to quickly change a config
some variables that you might need to know are these: 

- KERNELNAME - This variable contains the kernel name
- TARGETANDROID - Contains the target android OS
- VERSION - Contains the version of your kernel
- KDEBUG - If this variable contains the 'y' value then you'll see all the 
  kernel compilation process
- MAKEDTB - If this variable contains the value '1' it'll enable the device tree
  image generation for the current kernel build
- P - Path to the kernel source that will be used during the session of this software
- CLR - If this variable contains the value 'y' it'll enable the kernel source 
  cleaning on each kernel build

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# That's all #

This program, can run on every Linux machine and it's fully portable, you can
extract it anywhere you want but you must cd (enter this directory), to run
core.sh, once its done, you can use the commands wherever you are.

That's all, thanks for reading and happy building! If you need any support or
